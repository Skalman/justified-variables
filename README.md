same-size-word-o-nyms
=====================

List of related words of the same length. We're particularly interested in word
clusters with contrasting meanings, part-whole, antonyms, and frequently
associated programming / math jargon. Standard abbreviations are gladly
accepted.

I like it when my source code lines up nicely, don't you? Let's put an end to
ugly pairings such as open/close, alpha/beta, begin/end. Let's see more of
push/pull, success/failure, nodes/edges!
