Justified Variables
===================

I like it when my source code lines up nicely, don't you? Let's put an end to
ugly pairings, such as `open/close`, `alpha/beta`, `vertex/edge`. Let's see more
of `open/shut`, `node/edge`, `push/pull`!

`justified variables` are clusters of related words of the same length
(`justified` in fixed-width font). We're particularly interested in word
clusters with contrasting meanings, part-whole, antonyms, and frequently
associated programming / math jargon (`variables`). Standard abbreviations are
gladly accepted.
